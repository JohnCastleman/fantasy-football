      <tr><td><strong>WEEK 15 WAIVER WIRE REPORT (FAAB GUIDE)</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td><em>Intro: These are not concrete. I am not bidding these exact numbers in all of my leagues (especially if I'm in a league with you lol). These bids vary depending on your team needs, format, etc. A rule of thumb is I'm bidding these give or take 5-10% depending on the league and my team needs, and will specify if there's any that have big ranges. All of these players are under 40% owned on ESPN. Also some of these guys will be 5% bids or lower, feel free to put $0 bids on those guys or add them after waivers roll. Let's get into this</em><br/><em>THE PERCENT NEXT TO EACH PLAYER IS THE PERCENTAGE OF YOUR STARTING FAAB ID BE WILLING TO BID ON THE PLAYER. I ALMOST NEVER BID A DEAD EVEN ‘20%’, GO WITH WEIRD NUMBERS TO AVOID TIES. SO MAYBE 21% OR 18% ETC. I NEVER WANT A 0 OR 5 ON THE END BUT THAT'S PERSONAL PREFERENCE.</em></td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>RUNNING BACKS:</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td>NOTE: Keeping these FAAB bid ranges wide across the board. At this point in the season this all comes down to your desperation for a win and how bad your RB room is. Feel free to disregard my recommendations and bid however heavy you need to win</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>10-50% - Blake Corum</strong><br/>• RB3 in scoring over the last 2 weeks. Kyren handcuff with Monangai level starter upside<br/>• In today’s video I had Corum lower but after thinking about it he’s gotta be thee RB add this week.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>10-25% - Chris Rodriguez</strong><br/>• 10+ touches in 4 of his last 5<br/>• Consensus RB28 vs Giants who allow the 2nd most fantasy points to RBs</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>10-25% - Devin Singletary</strong><br/>• Tracy banged up, Singletary consensus RB30 this week vs Washington who allows 5th most points to RBs<br/>• Giants RBs have 4 top 15 ppr finishes in last 3 games (via ian hartitz)</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-10% - Brian Robinson</strong><br/>• CMC’s handcuff (CMC heightened injury risk)</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-10% - Tyler Allgeier</strong><br/>• handcuff/stash</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-10% - Jaylen Wright</strong><br/>• Achane banged up, his handcuff is Wright (for now)</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1% - Michael Carter</strong><br/>• Trey Benson continues to miss time, desperation RB3</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1% - Dylan Sampson</strong><br/>• 39% snap share his highest since the week 9 bye. Has made big plays</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1% - Samaje Perine</strong><br/>• Chase Brown’s handcuff</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1% - Ollie Gordon</strong><br/>• Achane banged up, maybe Jaylen Wright as RB2 was a fluke?</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>WIDE RECEIVERS:</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td><em>NOTE: If you are on this patreon you likely drafted WRs thru the flex plus 1 or 2 thru 10 rounds. If you have multiple Top 30ish WR options on your bench feel free to cut these bids in half. No need to sell out for players who will never crack your lineup.</em><br/><em>KEY:(YPRR=Yards Per Route Run, TPRR=Targets Per Route Run, XPPG=Expected Points Per Game)</em></td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>10-50% - Luther Burden</strong><br/>• Led all Bears WRs in target share, first read share, receiving 1st downs, yprr, yards, etc.<br/>• 6-4-67, 2.48 YPRR, 8.3 ADOT, 4 1st Downs. Really good stuff<br/>• Season high 69% of routes, have to think that continues to climb with Odunze sidelined.<br/>• Legit good player. Only rookie receiver with 20%+ TPRR, 2+ YPRR. 2nd best 1st Downs Per Route behind only Tet Mcmillan among rookies.<br/>• Trending where we need to go for a playoff hammer (probably better in best ball unless he jumps in route share to 80%+ next week)</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-10% - Jalen Coker</strong><br/>• Forgot about him on today’s video since he’s on bye<br/>• 10+ PPR in 2 of last 3 games. Was a fun player last year. Gets week 15 in a dome vs NO</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-10% - Ryan Flournoy</strong><br/>• If Lamb’s concussion is an issue, Flournoy is a flex play</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-10% - Devaughn Vele</strong><br/>• Back to back weeks of 26% target share</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-10% - Pat Bryant</strong><br/>• Rookie stashes<br/>• Pat Bryant’s route share fell by 10% but he ran more routes than troy Franklin for the 2nd week in a row. Bookmark for now</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-10% - Jack Bech</strong><br/>• Rookie stashes<br/>• Jack Bech. Showing life! 79% of the routes with a banged up Raiders WR room. 6-6-50, 2 1st downs, 1.61 YPRR. Not bad</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>TIGHT ENDS:</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>5-25% - Colston Loveland</strong><br/>• Consensus TE12 this week, boom/bust due to Kmet capping his route share</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>5-25% - Isaiah Likely</strong><br/>• Gets Cincinnati this week</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>5-25% - Mike Gesicki</strong><br/>• Tee Higgins concussion. 4+ targets in every game since his return</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>5-25% - Colby Parkinson</strong><br/>• TE5 since week 10</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1% - Mason Taylor</strong><br/>• Had 8 targets last week but QBs an issue</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>QUARTERBACKS:</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>5-25% - Marcus Mariota</strong><br/>• 8 PPG in his last 3 starts, JD hurt, again</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-5% - JJ McCarthy</strong><br/>• Gets the Cowboys who allow the most fantasy points to QBs</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-5% - Tyler Shough</strong><br/>• 20+ PPG in his last 2, gets CAR</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-5% - Shedeur Sanders</strong><br/>• 30 bomb last week gets CHI who allows 8th most points to QBs</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>DST</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>49ers</strong><br/>• Vs Titans (3rd most points to defenses)</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Bears</strong><br/>• Vs Browns (4th most points to defenses)</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Cowboys</strong><br/>• Vs Vikings (most points to defenses)</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Drop List (Guys you can drop if you need to make space):</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td><em>NOTE: IF LOOKING FOR GUYS TO DROP YOU CAN USE THE WAIVER BIDS FOR THIS. EXAMPLE: YOU’RE RB IS A 1% BID THIS WEEK, ANYONE IN THE 2%+ BID RANGE CAN BE ACQUIRED AT EXPENSE OF THIS RB. PLAYERS WITH THE SAME BID RANGE ARE IN THE SAME TIER.</em></td></tr>
