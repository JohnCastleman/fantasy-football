      <tr><td><strong>WEEK 13 WAIVER WIRE REPORT (FAAB GUIDE)</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td><em>Intro: These are not concrete. I am not bidding these exact numbers in all of my leagues (especially if I'm in a league with you lol). These bids vary depending on your team needs, format, etc. A rule of thumb is I'm bidding these give or take 5-10% depending on the league and my team needs, and will specify if there's any that have big ranges. All of these players are under 30% owned on ESPN. Also some of these guys will be 5% bids or lower, feel free to put $0 bids on those guys or add them after waivers roll. Let's get into this</em><br/><em>THE PERCENT NEXT TO EACH PLAYER IS THE PERCENTAGE OF YOUR STARTING FAAB ID BE WILLING TO BID ON THE PLAYER. I ALMOST NEVER BID A DEAD EVEN ‘20%’, GO WITH WEIRD NUMBERS TO AVOID TIES. SO MAYBE 21% OR 18% ETC. I NEVER WANT A 0 OR 5 ON THE END BUT THAT'S PERSONAL PREFERENCE.</em></td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>RUNNING BACKS:</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td>NOTE: Keeping these FAAB bid ranges wide across the board. At this point in the season this all comes down to your desperation for a win and how bad your RB room is</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>10-25% - Devin Neal</strong><br/>• Wouldn’t go crazy on Devin Neal. Kamara hurt but Shough/Taysom will pick up a lot of rushing and Neal’s 7 targets isn’t going to be sustainable with Kellen Moore who hasn’t gotten 4+ targets to kamara since week 6.<br/>• Buyer beware but if you’re beyond desperate for an RB2 and NEED to win I could justify emptying the clip</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>5-15% - Chris Rodriguez</strong><br/>• 30 snaps to Bill’s 18, Mcnichol’s 17<br/>• 16 touches. Maybe a startable RB?</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>5-15% - Bhayshul Tuten</strong><br/>• Reverted back to backup role, still a strong stash who can force a split at any time</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-10% - Brian Robinson</strong><br/>• CMC’s handcuff (CMC heightened injury risk)</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-10% - Blake Corum</strong><br/>• Kyren’s handcuff</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-10% - Raheem Mostert</strong><br/>• Ashton Jeanty hurt? Mostert is next man up, Zamir White in deep deep spots is interesting too</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-5% - Michael Carter</strong><br/>• Bam Knight was ruled out last week, Trey Benson likely back but Carter will be in the mix</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-5% - Dylan Sampson</strong><br/>• Rookie Upside. Jerome Ford had his lowest snap share of the year, Sampson balled out. Still behind Judkins in a bad offense</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-5% - Ollie Gordon</strong><br/>• On bye then gets NO, NYJ, PIT, CIN. Any Achane twisted ankle and thats a league winner</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1% - Dameon Pierce</strong><br/>• Signed with the Chiefs, probably nothing</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1% - Zamir White</strong><br/>• If Jeanty’s hurt, White could absorb the between the tackles work over Mostert</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>WIDE RECEIVERS:</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td><em>NOTE: If you are on this patreon you likely drafted WRs thru the flex plus 1 or 2 thru 10 rounds. If you have multiple Top 30ish WR options on your bench feel free to cut these bids in half. No need to sell out for players who will never crack your lineup.</em><br/><em>KEY:(YPRR=Yards Per Route Run, TPRR=Targets Per Route Run, XPPG=Expected Points Per Game)</em></td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>10-40% - Jayden Higgins</strong><br/>• Clearest rookie upside league winner candidate that’s available on waivers<br/>• 68% of the routes is his best since week 8 when Nico Collins was out. Now at 7+ targets in 4 of his last 5 games. 13+ PPR points in 3 of his last 5 games. His per route numbers get greener every week</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>5-25% - Parker Washington</strong><br/>• WR18 since week 9, BTJ looming though</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>5-25% - Tez Johnson</strong><br/>• WR33 since week 9, still like his upside after a TD this last week. Baker’s health the biggest question</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>5-25% - Luther Burden</strong><br/>• Still like his upside as a stash.<br/>• Back to back weeks of 60%+ route share, per route numbers look great. Was hoping for a bigger jump up but 5-3-46 with some rushing production for 9.1 PPR points is fine. 2 YPRR in this game. Leads the Bears in YPRR but DJ Moore scoring 2 TDs makes things tough for a real takeover.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>5-25% - Chimere Dike</strong><br/>• Chimere Dike now has 2 special teams TDs in his last 3 games. 5-44-1 receiving vs a tough SEA defense is strong too. He’s a guy but much more interested in Dynasty</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-10% - John Metchie</strong><br/>• Jets WR1 (until GW is back) with a better QB than Justin Fields</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-5% - Andrei Iosivas</strong><br/>• Tee Higgins out with a concussion on a short week.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1% - Greg Dortch</strong><br/>• Desperation dart throw. Marv likely back</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>TIGHT ENDS:</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>5-25% - Brenton Strange</strong><br/>• 1st game back 5-93, could be your longterm answer</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-10% - Mike Gesicki</strong><br/>• 6-4-35 in his first game back. No Tee Higgins this week most likely.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-5% - Isaiah Likely</strong><br/>• Gets the Bengals who are dead last vs TEs</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-5% - Taysom Hill</strong><br/>• No Kamara, is he the goal line back?</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>QUARTERBACKS:</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-10% - Trevor Lawrence</strong><br/>• Gets the Titans this week who allow the 12th most points.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-5% - Tua Tagovailoa</strong><br/>• Gets the Saints in Miami</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-5% - Cam Ward</strong><br/>• Plays the Jags who allow the 4th most points to QBs, Ward put up 20+ vs the Seahawks last week</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Drop List (Guys you can drop if you need to make space):</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td><em>NOTE: IF LOOKING FOR GUYS TO DROP YOU CAN USE THE WAIVER BIDS FOR THIS. EXAMPLE: YOU’RE RB IS A 1% BID THIS WEEK, ANYONE IN THE 2%+ BID RANGE CAN BE ACQUIRED AT EXPENSE OF THIS RB. PLAYERS WITH THE SAME BID RANGE ARE IN THE SAME TIER.</em></td></tr>
