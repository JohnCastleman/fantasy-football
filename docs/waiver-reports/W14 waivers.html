      <tr><td><strong>WEEK 14 WAIVER WIRE REPORT (FAAB GUIDE)</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td><em>Intro: These are not concrete. I am not bidding these exact numbers in all of my leagues (especially if I'm in a league with you lol). These bids vary depending on your team needs, format, etc. A rule of thumb is I'm bidding these give or take 5-10% depending on the league and my team needs, and will specify if there's any that have big ranges. All of these players are under 35% owned on ESPN. Also some of these guys will be 5% bids or lower, feel free to put $0 bids on those guys or add them after waivers roll. Let's get into this</em><br/><em>THE PERCENT NEXT TO EACH PLAYER IS THE PERCENTAGE OF YOUR STARTING FAAB ID BE WILLING TO BID ON THE PLAYER. I ALMOST NEVER BID A DEAD EVEN ‘20%’, GO WITH WEIRD NUMBERS TO AVOID TIES. SO MAYBE 21% OR 18% ETC. I NEVER WANT A 0 OR 5 ON THE END BUT THAT'S PERSONAL PREFERENCE.</em></td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>RUNNING BACKS:</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td>NOTE: Keeping these FAAB bid ranges wide across the board. At this point in the season this all comes down to your desperation for a win and how bad your RB room is. Feel free to disregard my recommendations and bid however heavy you need to win</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>10-50% - Chris Rodriguez</strong><br/>• 16 opportunities before the bye, then 12 opps after it.<br/>• Consensus RB28 this week vs MIN</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>10-50% - Devin Singletary</strong><br/>• Right on the fringe of priority add. Tyrone Tracy hurt, but Giants on bye and we don't know severity of his injury</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>5-15% - Blake Corum</strong><br/>• Kyren left the game with an injury, want pieces of the rams</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>5-15% - Bhayshul Tuten</strong><br/>• handcuff/stash (GL role? 3 TDs in 5 games)</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-10% - Tyler Allgeier</strong><br/>• handcuff/stash</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-10% - Brian Robinson</strong><br/>• CMC’s handcuff (CMC heightened injury risk)</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-5% - Michael Carter</strong><br/>• Trey Benson continues to miss time, desperation RB3</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1% - Ollie Gordon</strong><br/>• Achane’s handcuff</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1% - Samaje Perine</strong><br/>• 16 opportunities in his first game back. Was a weird gamescript but a handcuff if you want it</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>WIDE RECEIVERS:</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td><em>NOTE: If you are on this patreon you likely drafted WRs thru the flex plus 1 or 2 thru 10 rounds. If you have multiple Top 30ish WR options on your bench feel free to cut these bids in half. No need to sell out for players who will never crack your lineup.</em><br/><em>KEY:(YPRR=Yards Per Route Run, TPRR=Targets Per Route Run, XPPG=Expected Points Per Game)</em></td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-15% - AD Mitchell</strong><br/>• Fresh off 12-8-102-1<br/>• Tyrod has brought some stability to this passing game, gets MIA this week<br/>• Be weary because we just did this with John Metchie</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-15% - Pat Bryant</strong><br/>• Season high 77% route share, ahead of Franklin/Mims in routes and targets in this game. Was behind only Engram with 7 targets.<br/>• Hit 40+ yards for the 1st time in week 8, has hit 40+ in 4 of 5 games since then<br/>• Post bye rookie bump???</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-15% - Dontayvion Wicks</strong><br/>• 80% routes in week 12, 70% in week 13. Not quite enough to start him</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-10% - Jalen Coker</strong><br/>• On bye but 10+ PPR in 2 of last 3 weeks. Was a fun player last year. Gets week 15 in a dome vs NO</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-10% - Devaughn Vele</strong><br/>• Since Shaheed left, Vele has been a full time player. Skeptical of this sticking but well see!</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-5% - Isaac Teslaa</strong><br/>• ARSB hurt, rookie upside (???). 6.5% TPRR on the year, desperation flex even if ARSB misses</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-5% - Luther Burden</strong><br/>• Still stashing</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1% - Andrei Iosivas</strong><br/>• Tee Higgins out with concussion again?</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>TIGHT ENDS:</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>5-25% - Brenton Strange</strong><br/>• TE4 since returning in week 12<br/>• Consensus TE5 this week at home vs IND</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-10% - Darren Waller</strong><br/>• 69% of routes, 2nd highest on the year. Should be a fine TE2 streamer moving forward</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-3% - Mason Taylor</strong><br/>• 4+ targets in 3 straight games, Tyrod makes him startable as a fill in for Kittle vs the Dolphins who allow the 3rd most fpts to TEs</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>QUARTERBACKS:</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-10% - Trevor Lawrence</strong><br/>• 20+ in back to back games, gets the Colts this week in a neutral matchup</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1% - Tyrod Taylor</strong><br/>• Gets MIA this week who allows the 9th most points to QBs</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1% - Marcus Mariota</strong><br/>• It comes down to JD’s health. Proved vs the Broncos he's matchup proof. At MIN</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1% - Trey Lance</strong><br/>• Justin Herbert hurt?<br/>DST<br/>Bucs<br/>• Gets NO, ATL, CAR, MIA  (5th, 15th, 8th, 9th in points allowed to DST)<br/>• 4th in Havoc rate (% of plays a defense gets a pressure, TFL, forced fumble, INT, or pass breakup, via Ian Hartitz)<br/>Saints<br/>• 14th highest scoring D<br/>• TB, CAR, NYJ, TEN (15th, 8th, 10th, 2nd allowed to DST)<br/>Chiefs<br/>• HOU, LAC, TEN, DEN (19th, 11th, 2nd, 27th allowed to DST)<br/>• Can Spags figure it out?</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Drop List (Guys you can drop if you need to make space):</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td><em>NOTE: IF LOOKING FOR GUYS TO DROP YOU CAN USE THE WAIVER BIDS FOR THIS. EXAMPLE: YOU’RE RB IS A 1% BID THIS WEEK, ANYONE IN THE 2%+ BID RANGE CAN BE ACQUIRED AT EXPENSE OF THIS RB. PLAYERS WITH THE SAME BID RANGE ARE IN THE SAME TIER.</em></td></tr>
