  <h1>W12 waivers</h1>
  <table><tbody><tr><td><strong>WEEK 12 WAIVER WIRE REPORT (FAAB GUIDE)</strong></td></tr><tr><td><em>Intro: These are not concrete. I am not bidding these exact numbers in all of my leagues (especially if I'm in a league with you lol). These bids vary depending on your team needs, format, etc. A rule of thumb is I'm bidding these give or take 5-10% depending on the league and my team needs, and will specify if there's any that have big ranges. All of these players are under 50% owned on ESPN. Also some of these guys will be 5% bids or lower, feel free to put $0 bids on those guys or add them after waivers roll. Let's get into this</em><br/><em>THE PERCENT NEXT TO EACH PLAYER IS THE PERCENTAGE OF YOUR STARTING FAAB ID BE WILLING TO BID ON THE PLAYER. I ALMOST NEVER BID A DEAD EVEN ‘20%’, GO WITH WEIRD NUMBERS TO AVOID TIES. SO MAYBE 21% OR 18% ETC. I NEVER WANT A 0 OR 5 ON THE END BUT THAT'S PERSONAL PREFERENCE.</em></td></tr><tr><td><strong>RUNNING BACKS:</strong></td></tr><tr><td>NOTE: Keeping these FAAB bid ranges wide across the board. At this point in the season this all comes down to your desperation for a win and how bad your RB room is. If you are fighting for a wildcard spot and Tucker/Wilson would start for you, unload the clip! Same goes for the WRs.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>15-100% - Sean Tucker</strong><br/>• Tucker out touched Rachaad White 12 to 2 in second half. 19-106-2, 2-34-1<br/>• Top 24 option in any game without Bucky Irving (anywhere from 0-3ish games?)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>15-100% - Emmanuel Wilson</strong><br/>• 11-40-1, 1-9 receiving with Jacobs banged up. Could miss anywhere from 0-3+ games aswell. If you need RB help, splurge.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>5-25% - Kenneth Gainwell</strong><br/>• Jaylen Warren may not miss time, but Gainwell could still earn a bigger role. If Warren misses, Gainwell is as valuable as Wilson/Tucker.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>5-25% - Bhayshul Tuten</strong><br/>• Tuten outcarried ETN in the first half and scored the 1st TD. Sadly gets banged up<br/>• Still concerned about ankle, would be a 50/50 split most likely even if healthy</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1-10% - Devin Singletary</strong><br/>• Has taken all snaps inside the 10 over the last 3 weeks, poor mans charbonnet in a bad offense</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1-10% - Brian Robinson</strong><br/>• CMC’s handcuff (CMC heightened injury risk)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1-10% - Blake Corum</strong><br/>• Kyren’s handcuff</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1-10% - Chris Rodriguez</strong><br/>• 30 snaps to Bill’s 18, Mcnichol’s 17<br/>• 16 touches. Gets a bye week and then Denver.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1-10% - Tyjae Spears</strong><br/>• Ugly split but Pollard could get hurt or Spears could take over down the stretch</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1-5% - Bam Knight</strong><br/>• Demercado banged up. Benson return? Might be able to squeak out one more usable week</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1-5% - Ollie Gordon</strong><br/>• On bye then gets NO, NYJ, PIT, CIN. Any Achane twisted ankle and thats a league winner</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1% - Kaleb Johnson</strong><br/>• Warren banged up but not holding my breath</td></tr><tr><td><strong>WIDE RECEIVERS:</strong></td></tr><tr><td><em>NOTE: If you are on this patreon you likely drafted WRs thru the flex plus 1 or 2 thru 10 rounds. If you have multiple Top 30ish WR options on your bench feel free to cut these bids in half. No need to sell out for players who will never crack your lineup.</em><br/><em>KEY:(YPRR=Yards Per Route Run, TPRR=Targets Per Route Run, XPPG=Expected Points Per Game)</em></td></tr><tr><td><strong>10-50% - Christian Watson</strong><br/>• WR25 by consensus this week.<br/>• 65%, 75%, 83%, 80%. First blow up game. Strong boom/bust flex moving forward. 20+ point blow up 4-46-2</td></tr><tr><td><strong>10-50% - Michael Wilson</strong><br/>• 1-2 week rental until MHJ is back. Consensus top 24 WR this week you can plug and play after 15-185-0<br/>• Even when Marv returns he’ll be an interesting flex</td></tr><tr><td><strong>10-40% - Tez Johnson</strong><br/>• Tez was my pick to be the next Tank Dell but came crashing down with just 3-1-6, his worst game since week 3. Positive note: season high 97% of routes<br/>• Still plenty of upside</td></tr><tr><td><strong>10-40% - Luther Burden</strong><br/>• Season high 61% of the routes!!! Only 17% for Zacheeaus. Huge.<br/>• Season high 5 targets, just 3-27 though. Had his 2nd drop of the year, not his best game sadly to take advantage. But now we are standing by to see if we can get to 80%+ and throw him in lineups.<br/>• Per route metrics strong, route share trending up, we are ready for takeoff<br/><em>NOTE: THIS IS A STASH. I PREFER WASHINGTON/TUCKER IF NEED A SPOT START</em></td></tr><tr><td><strong>5-25% - Parker Washington</strong><br/>• Dud week but still a fine flex</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1-10% - Tre Tucker</strong><br/>• Fine flex option</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1% - Darnell Mooney</strong><br/>• Broke collarbone in offseason, has been awful but London banged up</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1% - Jayden Higgins</strong><br/>• Purely a stash. 57% of routes, ran more than Hutchinson. Still just not enough. I hate this staff. 7+ targets in 3 of the last 4. Per route numbers improving every week, arrow up on Higgins.<br/>• Stash until these coaches can get out of their own way</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1% - Andrei Iosivas</strong><br/>• No Jamarr Chase, could be a flex play with Gonzo on Tee Higgins</td></tr><tr><td><strong>TIGHT ENDS:</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>5-20% - Juwan Johnson</strong><br/>• On bye but a monster without Shaheed (10+ in 4 straight)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>5-20% - Cade Otton</strong><br/>• 5+ targets in 6 straight games</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1-5% - AJ Barner</strong><br/>• 3 PPG on the year quietly ahead of Hunter Henry, David Njoku, TJ Hockenson, etc</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1-5% - Dawson Knox</strong><br/>• If Kincaid misses you can throw him in, ran 70%+ routes in a good offense</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1-5% - Colston Loveland</strong><br/>• Kmet limiting routes but good stash</td></tr><tr><td><strong>QUARTERBACKS:</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>5-25% - Jacoby Brissett</strong><br/>• QB4 in PPG since taking over in week 6<br/>• Feel free to be aggressive if QB is costing you wins</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1-5% - Jameis Winston</strong><br/>• If Dart misses you get Jameis in comeback mode vs Detroit in a dome. Could see 40+ attempts</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Drop List (Guys you can drop if you need to make space):</strong></td></tr><tr><td><em>NOTE: IF LOOKING FOR GUYS TO DROP YOU CAN USE THE WAIVER BIDS FOR THIS. EXAMPLE: YOU’RE RB IS A 1% BID THIS WEEK, ANYONE IN THE 2%+ BID RANGE CAN BE ACQUIRED AT EXPENSE OF THIS RB. PLAYERS WITH THE SAME BID RANGE ARE IN THE SAME TIER.</em></td></tr><tr><td>• Jerome Ford</td></tr><tr><td>• Marvin Mims</td></tr><tr><td>• Braelon Allen (If Breece goes down, Davis is a real issue)</td></tr><tr><td>• Jayden Reed (Hurt)</td></tr><tr><td>• Joe Burrow (Hurt)</td></tr><tr><td>• JJ McCarthy (Hurt)</td></tr><tr><td>• James Conner (Hurt)</td></tr><tr><td>• Malik Nabers (Hurt)</td></tr><tr><td>• Joe Mixon</td></tr><tr><td>• Cooper Kupp</td></tr><tr><td>• Donte Thornton</td></tr><tr><td>• Geno Smith</td></tr><tr><td>• Rashod Bateman</td></tr><tr><td>• Chris Rodriguez &amp; Jeremy Mcnichols</td></tr><tr><td>• Hassan Haskins</td></tr><tr><td>• Skattebo</td></tr><tr><td>• Jaydon Blue</td></tr><tr><td>• Mason Taylor</td></tr><tr><td>• Tank Bigsby</td></tr></tbody></table>
