      <tr><td><strong>WEEK 17 WAIVER WIRE REPORT (FAAB GUIDE)</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td><em>Intro: These are not concrete. I am not bidding these exact numbers in all of my leagues (especially if I'm in a league with you lol). These bids vary depending on your team needs, format, etc. A rule of thumb is I'm bidding these give or take 5-10% depending on the league and my team needs, and will specify if there's any that have big ranges. All of these players are under 40% owned on ESPN. Also some of these guys will be 5% bids or lower, feel free to put $0 bids on those guys or add them after waivers roll. Let's get into this</em><br/><em>THE PERCENT NEXT TO EACH PLAYER IS THE PERCENTAGE OF YOUR STARTING FAAB ID BE WILLING TO BID ON THE PLAYER. I ALMOST NEVER BID A DEAD EVEN ‘20%’, GO WITH WEIRD NUMBERS TO AVOID TIES. SO MAYBE 21% OR 18% ETC. I NEVER WANT A 0 OR 5 ON THE END BUT THAT'S PERSONAL PREFERENCE.</em><br/><em>NOTE: Removing FAAB this week. It's do or die. Bid whatever you need to win. Prioritizing players you can start this week over ‘stashes’.</em></td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>RUNNING BACKS</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Emmanuel Wilson</strong><br/>• Josh Jacobs banged up, would be a top 24 start if he can’t go</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Blake Corum</strong><br/>• RB8 since week 13</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Michael Carter</strong><br/>• Carter was not the bellcow despite the injuries. Was a weird 3 way split<br/>• BUT he gets the Bengals who allow the most points to RBs</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Dylan Sampson</strong><br/>• Has missed time but if he suits up with Judkins hurt, he’s a strong start.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Chris Rodriguez</strong><br/>• Back to RB1, gets DAL who allows the 7th most to RBs</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Jawhar Jordan</strong><br/>• Jawhar Jordan is the leadback (if Marks cant go)</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Raheim Sanders</strong><br/>• Judkins out, Sampson has missed time but could return.<br/>• Rocket Sanders is a fun player who could be the RB1 for the Browns this week</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>WIDE RECEIVERS:</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td><em>NOTE: If you are on this patreon you likely drafted WRs thru the flex plus 1 or 2 thru 10 rounds. If you have multiple Top 30ish WR options on your bench feel free to cut these bids in half. No need to sell out for players who will never crack your lineup.</em><br/><em>KEY:(YPRR=Yards Per Route Run, TPRR=Targets Per Route Run, XPPG=Expected Points Per Game)</em></td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Parker Washington</strong><br/>• Coming off a big week, gets the Colts who allow the 4th most points to WRs</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Adonai Mitchell</strong><br/>• Likely not available but a boom/bust flex in any given week</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Luther Burden</strong><br/>• Could be back this week but this is the range of WRs that are pure dart throws</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Jalen Coker</strong><br/>• 10+ PPR points in 3 of his last 5</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Kyle Williams</strong><br/>• 10+ PPR in 2 of his last 3, maybe a spike week vs the Jets? Might get more run in garbage time?</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>TIGHT ENDS:</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Brenton Strange</strong><br/>• Coming off 7-5-39-1, gets a banged up Colts D that just let Kittle run wild on MNF</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Taysom Hill</strong><br/>• 1/1 38 1 passing, 12-42 rushing, 4-36 receiving. Old Taysom could be back with no Devin neal but this could be a massive trap in a fantasy championship game</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>AJ Barner</strong><br/>• Ran a ton of routes last week, low end streamer.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>QUARTERBACKS:</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Tyler Shough</strong><br/>• QB12 since week 10, gets TEN who allows 8th most points to QBs</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Geno Smith</strong><br/>• Shot in the dark but options are limited. Giants allow 5th most QB points</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>DST</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Giants at LV</strong><br/>• If Geno Smith implodes the Giants are a great start. DST5 over the last 2 weeks.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Bucs at MIA</strong><br/>• Quinn Ewers.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Drop List (Guys you can drop if you need to make space):</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td><em>NOTE: IF LOOKING FOR GUYS TO DROP YOU CAN USE THE WAIVER BIDS FOR THIS. EXAMPLE: YOU’RE RB IS A 1% BID THIS WEEK, ANYONE IN THE 2%+ BID RANGE CAN BE ACQUIRED AT EXPENSE OF THIS RB. PLAYERS WITH THE SAME BID RANGE ARE IN THE SAME TIER.</em></td></tr>
