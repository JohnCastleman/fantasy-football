      <tr><td><strong>WEEK 11 WAIVER WIRE REPORT (FAAB GUIDE)</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td><em>Intro: These are not concrete. I am not bidding these exact numbers in all of my leagues (especially if I'm in a league with you lol). These bids vary depending on your team needs, format, etc. A rule of thumb is I'm bidding these give or take 5-10% depending on the league and my team needs, and will specify if there's any that have big ranges. All of these players are under 50% owned on ESPN. Also some of these guys will be 5% bids or lower, feel free to put $0 bids on those guys or add them after waivers roll. Let's get into this</em><br/><em>THE PERCENT NEXT TO EACH PLAYER IS THE PERCENTAGE OF YOUR STARTING FAAB ID BE WILLING TO BID ON THE PLAYER. I ALMOST NEVER BID A DEAD EVEN ‘20%’, GO WITH WEIRD NUMBERS TO AVOID TIES. SO MAYBE 21% OR 18% ETC. I NEVER WANT A 0 OR 5 ON THE END BUT THAT'S PERSONAL PREFERENCE.</em></td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>RUNNING BACKS:</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>5-25% - Trey Benson</strong><br/>• Will be back soon, the backfield is a mess. Best bet at a startable RB</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>5-15% - Sean Tucker</strong><br/>• You’ll notice this is MUCH higher than I had him on the waiver video. Thinking about it more and a takeover is very much possible. Allgeier/BRob/Corum&gt;Tucker/Demercado as pure stashes but Tucker/Demercado have real plug and play upside for people who need points now<br/>• Who knows if Bucky ever returns. 11 opps to Rachaad White’s 15. Tucker has been more efficient. Gap closing. Losing to the Patriots could be enough motivation to try something different at RB</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>5-15% - Emari Demercado</strong><br/>• Read above. Also 13.4 PPR points last week</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>5-15% - Tyler Allgeier</strong><br/>• Bijans handcuff, shouldn’t be available anywhere.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-10% - Brian Robinson</strong><br/>• CMC’s handcuff (CMC heightened injury risk)</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-10% - Blake Corum</strong><br/>• Kyren’s handcuff</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-10% - Tyjae Spears</strong><br/>• Ugly split but Pollard could get hurt or Spears could take over down the stretch</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-5% - Bhayshul Tuten</strong><br/>• ETN’s Handcuff with upside</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1% - Isaiah Davis</strong><br/>• Breece handcuff</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1% - Devin Singletary</strong><br/>• Tracy’s handcuff with standalone upside</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1% - Dylan Sampson</strong><br/>• Gaining some ground on Jerome Ford</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1% - Ollie Gordon</strong><br/>• Achane’s handcuff</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1% - Emmanuel Wilson</strong><br/>• Jacobs’ handcuff</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>WIDE RECEIVERS:</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td><em>NOTE: If you are on this patreon you likely drafted WRs thru the flex plus 1 or 2 thru 10 rounds. If you have multiple Top 30ish WR options on your bench feel free to cut these bids in half. No need to sell out for players who will never crack your lineup.</em><br/><em>KEY:(YPRR=Yards Per Route Run, TPRR=Targets Per Route Run, XPPG=Expected Points Per Game)</em></td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>10-75% - Alec Pierce</strong><br/>• WR12 over his last 4 weeks. On bye but if you have any weakness at WR, go all out. Pierce can flat out play</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>10-40% - Tez Johnson</strong><br/>• 5-4-42-2, definitely a Horton style statline but this is his role as a boom/bust flex. Not going to overtake Egbuka but really strong start for a Day 3 WR. 87% routes is great too. Rookie upside to be a difference maker down the stretch</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>10-40% - Luther Burden</strong><br/>• Huge upside with DJ Moore banged up<br/>• Luther Burden sets a season high 49% route share<br/>• 3-3-51, 2 1st downs, 2.55 YPRR. Really strong stuff. How long will DJ Moore be out? Can Burden jump Zachheaus?</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>10-40% - Christian Watson</strong><br/>• Routes up 65%&gt;75%&gt;83%. Boom/bust flex</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>5-25% - Parker Washington</strong><br/>• Parker Washington 20%+ target share in each of his last 3, WR18 over his last 3</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-10% - Tre Tucker</strong><br/>• Fine flex option</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-10% - Darius Slayton</strong><br/>• Back to back 10+ PPR point games</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-10% - Mack Hollins</strong><br/>• If Boutte is out Mack Hollins is a strong start</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-5% - Kyle Williams</strong><br/>• Would slow your roll on a “breakout” but love to see him make a play. 2-1-72-1 statline but we need steady, repeatable production. Got up to 58% of the routes, will see if this sticks when Kayshon Boutte returns</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1% - Jayden Higgins</strong><br/>• Higgins ahead of Noel on the depth chart, 7-5-42-1 is a strong outing on his route share (career high PPR output). Just not enough routes to be more than stash or desperate flex</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>TIGHT ENDS:</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>5-20% - Dalton Schultz</strong><br/>• 10+ in 4 of his last 5</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>5-20% - Theo Johnson</strong><br/>• 10+ in 5 of his last 7</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>5-20% - Cade Otton</strong><br/>• 10+ in 4 of his last 5</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>5-20% - Juwan Johnson</strong><br/>• On bye but a monster without Shaheed (10+ in 4 straight)</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-10% - Colston Loveland</strong><br/>• Kmet limiting routes but good stash</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>QUARTERBACKS:</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-5% - Marcus Mariota</strong><br/>• Plays MIA</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-5% - Joe Flacco</strong><br/>• Plays PIT</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-5% - Jacoby Brissett</strong><br/>• 19+ in all 4 starts.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Drop List (Guys you can drop if you need to make space):</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td><em>NOTE: IF LOOKING FOR GUYS TO DROP YOU CAN USE THE WAIVER BIDS FOR THIS. EXAMPLE: YOU’RE RB IS A 1% BID THIS WEEK, ANYONE IN THE 2%+ BID RANGE CAN BE ACQUIRED AT EXPENSE OF THIS RB. PLAYERS WITH THE SAME BID RANGE ARE IN THE SAME TIER.</em></td></tr>
      <tr><td>• Jerome Ford</td></tr>
      <tr><td>• Marvin Mims</td></tr>
      <tr><td>• Braelon Allen (If Breece goes down, Davis is a real issue)</td></tr>
