      <tr><td><strong>WEEK 10 WAIVER WIRE REPORT (FAAB GUIDE)</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td><em>Intro: These are not concrete. I am not bidding these exact numbers in all of my leagues (especially if I'm in a league with you lol). These bids vary depending on your team needs, format, etc. A rule of thumb is I'm bidding these give or take 5-10% depending on the league and my team needs, and will specify if there's any that have big ranges. All of these players are under 50% owned on ESPN. Also some of these guys will be 5% bids or lower, feel free to put $0 bids on those guys or add them after waivers roll. Let's get into this</em><br/><em>THE PERCENT NEXT TO EACH PLAYER IS THE PERCENTAGE OF YOUR STARTING FAAB ID BE WILLING TO BID ON THE PLAYER. I ALMOST NEVER BID A DEAD EVEN ‘20%’, GO WITH WEIRD NUMBERS TO AVOID TIES. SO MAYBE 21% OR 18% ETC. I NEVER WANT A 0 OR 5 ON THE END BUT THAT'S PERSONAL PREFERENCE.</em></td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>RUNNING BACKS:</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>5-15% - Trey Benson</strong><br/>• Will be back soon, back field is a mess</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>5-15% - Tyler Allgeier</strong><br/>• Bijans handcuff, shouldn’t be available anywhere.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>5-15% - Bhayshul Tuten</strong><br/>• ETN’s Handcuff with upside</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-10% - Isaiah Davis</strong><br/>• Breece handcuff (w/ rec upside, could Breece get traded?)</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-10% - Devin Singletary</strong><br/>• 50/50 split vs Tracy</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>5-15% - Tyjae Spears</strong><br/>• Ugly split but Pollard could get hurt or Spears could take over down the stretch</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-5% - Dylan Sampson</strong><br/>• Judkins banged up, post bye rookie bump?</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-5% - Tank Bigsby</strong><br/>• 100+ yards, Saquon handcuff</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-5% - Brian Robinson</strong><br/>• CMC’s handcuff (CMC heightened injury risk)</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-5% - Blake Corum</strong><br/>• Kyren’s handcuff</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1% - Emari Demercado</strong><br/>• Was involved on Monday night</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1% - Ollie Gordon</strong><br/>• Achane’s handcuff</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1% - Emmanuel Wilson</strong><br/>• Jacobs’ handcuff</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1% - Terrell Jennings</strong><br/>• I’ve seen crazier things than a guy named Terrell Jennings being relevant</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1% - Devin Neal</strong><br/>• Kendre Miller tore his ACL. Neal is a fun rookie and the next man up behind Kamara</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>WIDE RECEIVERS:</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td><em>NOTE: If you are on this patreon you likely drafted WRs thru the flex plus 1 or 2 thru 10 rounds. If you have multiple Top 30ish WR options on your bench feel free to cut these bids in half. No need to sell out for players who will never crack your lineup.</em><br/><em>KEY:(YPRR=Yards Per Route Run, TPRR=Targets Per Route Run, XPPG=Expected Points Per Game)</em></td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>10-40% - Tre Tucker</strong><br/><em>NOTE: These top 6 or so WRs are all legit flex options. Be aggressive if they would slot into your flex spot.</em><br/>• Jakobi Meyers gone, 40+ PPR points in his past. Fine flex option</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>10-40% - Tez Johnson</strong><br/>• This passing offense couldnt really get going vs NO but his per route numbers across the board are strong for a rookie. Could be this year’s Jalen McMillan?</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>10-40% - Christian Watson</strong><br/>• Golden banged up, Kraft out for the year<br/>• Watson goes from 65% to 75% of the routes. 50+ receiving yards in his last 2 games</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>5-20% - Alec Pierce</strong><br/>• WR17 over the last 3 weeks. Boom/bust flex</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-10% - Darius Slayton</strong><br/>• 7-5-62 this week as a flex option next to Wandale</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-10% - Parker Washington</strong><br/>• Jakobi Meyers now here but still had flex appeal</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-5% - Demario Douglas</strong><br/>• Boutte banged up. Douglas higher floor, Williams rookie upside</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1% - Kyle Williams</strong><br/>• Read above</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1% - AD Mitchell</strong><br/>• Good prospect once upon a time popped on the rookie receiver report. Only pick him up if desperate</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1% - Jack Bech</strong><br/>• Maybe rookie upside with Jakobi Meyers gone but highly unlikely. Only pick him up if desperate.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>TIGHT ENDS:</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>5-40% - Colston Loveland</strong><br/>• My god. 7-6-118-2, game winning TD. Just an absolute monster performance. 4 1st downs, 158.3 (perfect) passer rating when targeted. Huge rookie upside<br/>• Lose Kraft? Go all out</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>5-15% - Juwan Johnson</strong><br/>• Big upgrade with no Shaheed</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-10% - Theo Johnson</strong><br/>• Running routes, 10+ PPR points in 4 of his last 6</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-10% - Mason Taylor</strong><br/>• Not confident in any Jets passing game piece besides GW but big game. Rookie upside?</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-5% - Dalton Schultz</strong><br/>• 10+ PPR points in 3 of his last 4. Collins/Kirk getting healthy</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1% - Luke Musgrave</strong><br/>• No Kraft but doubt hes that relevant</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>QUARTERBACKS:</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-15% - Sam Darnold</strong><br/>• Still not rostered in enough places, averaging same PPG as Baker Mayfield as a high end QB2 with 17.8 PPG</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-5% - Marcus Mariota</strong><br/>• Averaging 16.9 PPG in his 3 starts. JD out for year</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1-5% - JJ McCarthy</strong><br/>• Looked good vs Lions, gets a beatable Ravens D this week</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Drop List (Guys you can drop if you need to make space):</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td><em>NOTE: IF LOOKING FOR GUYS TO DROP YOU CAN USE THE WAIVER BIDS FOR THIS. EXAMPLE: YOU’RE RB IS A 1% BID THIS WEEK, ANYONE IN THE 2%+ BID RANGE CAN BE ACQUIRED AT EXPENSE OF THIS RB. PLAYERS WITH THE SAME BID RANGE ARE IN THE SAME TIER.</em></td></tr>
      <tr><td>• Jerome Ford</td></tr>
