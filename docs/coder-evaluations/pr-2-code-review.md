### [SEVERITY: High] Null Display Bug in Player Count Message

**Location:** `client/client.js:16-26`

**Issue:**  
When `options.displayMaxPlayers` is explicitly passed as `null`, the function will attempt to slice with null and display "showing null of X players" in the output message. The destructuring default only applies when the property is undefined, not when it's explicitly null.

**Why This Matters:**  
This creates confusing output for users and violates the documented behavior that null should mean "show all players." While `slice(0, null)` happens to work correctly (showing all), the user-facing message will be broken.

**Current Code:**
```javascript
const { displayMaxPlayers = Settings.displayMaxPlayers ?? 0, verbose = Settings.verbose } = options;

if (displayMaxPlayers !== 0) {
  players.slice(0, displayMaxPlayers).forEach(player => {
    console.log(playerToString(player));
  });
  console.log('... (showing', displayMaxPlayers, 'of', players.length, 'players)');
}
```

**Suggested Fix:**
```javascript
const rawMaxPlayers = options.displayMaxPlayers ?? Settings.displayMaxPlayers;
const displayMaxPlayers = rawMaxPlayers ?? 0;
const { verbose = Settings.verbose } = options;

if (displayMaxPlayers !== 0) {
  players.slice(0, displayMaxPlayers).forEach(player => {
    console.log(playerToString(player));
  });
  console.log('... (showing', displayMaxPlayers, 'of', players.length, 'players)');
}
```

**Explanation:**  
Explicitly handle null coalescing before destructuring to ensure both null and undefined are normalized to 0. This prevents null from leaking into the display message while maintaining the "show all" behavior.

**Alternative approach:**  
Handle the display message separately to account for the "show all" case without displaying a count at all, or display "showing all X players" when limit is null/0.

### [SEVERITY: High] Significant Test Coverage Reduction

**Location:** `client/tests/runner.js:17-19, 103-117`

**Issue:**  
The refactoring changes from testing multiple ranking types (array) to testing a single ranking type (enum value). The old code defaulted to testing all 4 ranking types (ROS, WEEKLY, DYNASTY, DRAFT). The new code tests only the single configured type, with DRAFT as the defensive default.

**Why This Matters:**  
This is a breaking change that dramatically reduces test coverage. Unless there's a specific reason to test only one ranking type at a time, this removes the ability to run comprehensive tests across all ranking types with a single test run. The PR description mentions this is a "simple renaming" but this is actually a semantic change in test behavior.

**Current Code:**
```javascript
const rankingTypeToTest = rankingType ?? RankingTypeEnum.DRAFT; // defensive default for ranking type is DRAFT

// ...later...
for (const position of positionsToTest) {
  if (displayFunctions[rankingTypeToTest] && displayFunctions[rankingTypeToTest][position]) {
    displayFunctions[rankingTypeToTest][position]();
  }
}
```

**Old Code:**
```javascript
const rankingTypesToTest = testRankingTypes === null
  ? [RankingTypeEnum.ROS, RankingTypeEnum.WEEKLY, RankingTypeEnum.DYNASTY, RankingTypeEnum.DRAFT]
  : testRankingTypes;

// ...later...
for (const rankingType of rankingTypesToTest) {
  for (const position of positionsToTest) {
    if (displayFunctions[rankingType] && displayFunctions[rankingType][position]) {
      displayFunctions[rankingType][position]();
    }
  }
}
```

**Suggested Fix:**  
If the intent is to enable testing a single ranking type for faster iteration (which is mentioned in the CLI parameter plans), this should:
1. Be clearly documented in the PR description as an intentional behavior change
2. Consider keeping both capabilities: test a single ranking type OR test all ranking types
3. Update test settings comments to explain when/why you'd test only one ranking type

**Explanation:**  
The reduction from comprehensive testing to single-type testing is a significant architectural decision that affects the reliability of the test suite. This should either be reverted to maintain existing test coverage, or clearly justified with an explanation of the new testing strategy.

### [SEVERITY: Medium] Inconsistent Null Handling Patterns

**Location:** `client/tests/runner.js:17-25`

**Issue:**  
The code uses two different patterns for handling null defaults in the same function:
- `rankingType` uses nullish coalescing operator: `rankingType ?? RankingTypeEnum.DRAFT`
- `positions` uses explicit null check: `positions === null ? [...] : positions`

**Why This Matters:**  
Inconsistent patterns make the code harder to understand and maintain. Developers reading the code need to understand why different approaches are used for similar settings, or assume there's a semantic difference when there isn't one.

**Current Code:**
```javascript
const rankingTypeToTest = rankingType ?? RankingTypeEnum.DRAFT; // defensive default for ranking type is DRAFT

// Determine which positions to test  
const positionsToTest = positions === null
  ? [PositionEnum.QB, PositionEnum.RB, PositionEnum.WR, PositionEnum.TE, PositionEnum.K, PositionEnum.DST]
  : positions;
```

**Suggested Fix:**
```javascript
const rankingTypeToTest = rankingType ?? RankingTypeEnum.DRAFT; // defensive default for ranking type is DRAFT

// Determine which positions to test  
const positionsToTest = positions ?? [
  PositionEnum.QB, PositionEnum.RB, PositionEnum.WR, 
  PositionEnum.TE, PositionEnum.K, PositionEnum.DST
];
```

**Explanation:**  
Use the nullish coalescing operator consistently for both settings since they have the same semantic: "if not provided (null/undefined), use this default." This makes the code more uniform and easier to scan.

### [SEVERITY: Medium] Unclear Defensive Default Choice

**Location:** `client/tests/runner.js:19`

**Issue:**  
The comment states "defensive default for ranking type is DRAFT" but doesn't explain why DRAFT was chosen over ROS, WEEKLY, or DYNASTY. There's no documentation in the PR or in the code explaining the reasoning.

**Why This Matters:**  
Defensive defaults should be chosen deliberately. DRAFT might not be the most common ranking type users actually want (ROS or WEEKLY are arguably more common for season-long fantasy), and without explanation, future maintainers won't know if this was intentional or arbitrary.

**Current Code:**
```javascript
const rankingTypeToTest = rankingType ?? RankingTypeEnum.DRAFT; // defensive default for ranking type is DRAFT
```

**Suggested Fix:**
```javascript
// Default to DRAFT ranking for tests as it's static and doesn't depend on current week
const rankingTypeToTest = rankingType ?? RankingTypeEnum.DRAFT;
```

Or alternatively, consider if there's a better default:
```javascript
// Default to ROS (Rest of Season) as it's the most commonly used ranking type
const rankingTypeToTest = rankingType ?? RankingTypeEnum.ROS;
```

**Explanation:**  
Add a comment explaining the reasoning behind the default choice. If DRAFT was chosen because it's week-independent (doesn't require knowing current NFL week), that's valuable context. If it was arbitrary, consider whether ROS or WEEKLY would be better defaults.

### [SEVERITY: Low] Minor Comment Formatting Inconsistency

**Location:** `client/settings.js:4-5`

**Issue:**  
Minor formatting inconsistency in comment spacing across the settings file.

**Why This Matters:**  
Very minor impact, but consistent formatting improves readability. This is a nitpick that could be addressed by a linter/formatter.

**Current Code:**
```javascript
verbose: false, // Whether to show detailed ranking metadata (and, later, expanded player stats)
displayMaxPlayers: null, // Default number of players to show in display rankings; set to null or 0 to show all
```

**Observation:**  
Not really an issue - the comments are fine as-is. Consider running Prettier or similar formatter if consistent spacing is important to the project.

---

## Positive Observations

1. **Clear Intent**: The renamings (`displaySize` → `displayMaxPlayers`, `testPositions` → `positions`) improve code clarity
2. **Simplified Logic**: Removing the nested loop in test runner makes the code easier to follow (though this comes at cost of coverage)
3. **Good Documentation**: The PR description clearly outlines the three main changes with file references
4. **Testing Performed**: Author confirmed test suite passes with `npm test`
5. **Documentation Updated**: `docs/development.md` was updated to reflect completed work

---

## Recommendations

### Priority Actions Before Merge:

1. **Fix the null display bug** in `client/client.js` (High priority) - handle null coalescing properly to prevent "showing null of X players" message
2. **Address test coverage reduction** (High priority) - Either:
   - Document this as an intentional change with clear reasoning
   - Restore ability to test multiple ranking types
   - Add follow-up issue to restore comprehensive testing capability

### Follow-up Improvements:

1. Apply consistent null handling patterns throughout the codebase
2. Document the reasoning behind the DRAFT default choice
3. Consider adding tests that specifically verify the null/0 handling behavior for `displayMaxPlayers`

### Long-term Considerations:

1. The CLI parameter overrides mentioned in the planning document should address the testing flexibility issue
2. Consider whether the settings structure needs a more formal validation layer as the configuration grows more complex

---

## Overall Assessment

**Needs Changes Before Merge**

This PR accomplishes its stated goal of "simple renamings" but introduces two significant issues:

1. A functional bug with null handling that affects user-facing output
2. A semantic change in test behavior that reduces coverage without clear justification

The renamings themselves are solid improvements to code clarity. However, the implementation details need refinement before this can be safely merged. The null bug is straightforward to fix, and the test coverage issue needs either clear documentation or a design reconsideration.

With these two items addressed, this would be a clean, well-documented refactoring that improves the codebase.
