He practiced on a limited basis all week and doesn't carry an injury designation into this game. In the last game that Slayton played, he left with a hamstring issue. Before he was knocked out of the game, in the first half, he had a 31.3% target share, a 94.1% air-yard share, and a 36.4% first-read share. Slayton was essentially operating as Malik Nabers for the Giants. He could command a similar volume this week from Jaxson Dart. The problem for Slayton is that he could draw shadow coverage from Quinyon Mitchell this week. Mitchell has followed Emeka Egbuka, Courtland Sutton, and Davante Adams this season on 65-79.4% of their routes. Only Sutton surpassed 12 receiving yards in Mitchell's primary coverage. If Mitchell doesn't follow him, Slayton could have a nice day against a secondary that has allowed the third-most receiving yards per game and the tenth-most fantasy points per game to perimeter wide receivers.","tag":null,"recommendation":null,"pos_rank":"WR61","start_sit_grade":"D+","r2p_pts":"3.8"},{"player_id":25335,"player_name":"Andrei Iosivas","sportsdata_id":"30c0df5e-bb77-4eee-8390-8fc13844e1c3","player_team_id":"CIN","player_position_id":"WR","player_positions":"WR","player_short_name":"A.
