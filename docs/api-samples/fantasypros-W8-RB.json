As a receiving option, he has a 7.3% target share, a 51% target per route run rate, 3.49 yards per route run, and 0.143 first downs per route run. Last week, in the first half, Smith played 26.2% of the snaps with a 27.6% route share and a 16.7% target share (four targets). Smith is a viable flex this week in PPR formats.
