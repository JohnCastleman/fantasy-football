This week, he faces a Kansas City defense that has the fourth-highest two-high rate in the NFL (58.5%). Against two high, Ertz has a 22.9% target share, 2.15 yards per route run, and a 34.24% first-read share. He'll get plenty of volume this week, but the matchup is rough as Kansas City has allowed the second-fewest schedule-adjusted fantasy points per game to tight ends.","tag":"start","recommendation":null,"pos_rank":"TE16","start_sit_grade":"D+","r2p_pts":"5.2"},{"player_id":18290,"player_name":"T.J.
